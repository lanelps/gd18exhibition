					<div class="state">
						Pol Pot was the leader of the Khmer Rouge and applied Chinese communist ideologies to
						Cambodia with devastating effects. The Khmer Rouge targeted educated people, who were
						considered a threat to their regime, killing doctors, artists, musicians, scholars and monks in the
						process. Between 1975 and 1979, 3 million Cambodians are estimated to have been killed. The
						Khmer Rouge resulted in immediate loss of Cambodian knowledge, culture and customs, and the
						people of Cambodian sought refuge in other countries to flee the genocide. As a result, there are
						now Cambodian communities scattered across America, Australian, France, New Zealand and
						other parts of the world, still holding on to their culture. Second-generation Cambodians in these
						communities have a second-hand knowledge of their culture through their parents and grandparents
						war stories. These communities are geographically isolated from each other across the
						world and the internet plays a key role in connecting these people together.
						The name ‘Scattered Offerings’ acknowledges the people of Cambodia and how they have been
						scattered throughout the world due to the Khmer rouge regime and the genocide. ‘Offerings’
						refers to the placing of offerings to Buddha or your ancestors, a practice used within Buddhism,
						and acknowledges the Cambodian religious identity.
						<br><br>
						‘Scattered Offerings’ has a minimal identity to communicate clearly and focus on the stories
						submitted. A continuous sillouette runs along the header of each page of the website. While
						some sillouettes show classic scenery of Cambodian landscape and architecture, others show
						daily occurances such as farmers taking to the fields or monks in prayer. This scenery is
						reminiscent of the happier days and beauty of Cambodian culture. The continuous line is
						representative of a heartbeat, of survival and furthermore the necessity for the Cambodian
						culture to thrive.
						<br><br>
						The colour palette of ‘Scattered Offerings’ is limited to black and white. This minimal palette
						adheres to Communist ideology – that is, restricted creative expression, lack of indulgence in
						culture and art. The use of black and white is appropriate to the bleak nature of the stories
						submitted by Khmer Rouge survivors.
						<br><br>
						Submitted stories are categorised according to three fields: date submitted, user’s location, user
						type (user, third person, anonymous). When the user enters a submission online, they are
						required to enter the current date, location, title of story, text, and optional photos with captions.
						For a guest user, they may find stories through the world map on the main page (with the ability
						to search stories by continent), user profiles, keywords in search bar, or use the archive page to
						search by date, location and submission (or a combination of the above).
						<br><br>
						The world map on the main page, with black squares scattered across, serves as a visual
						component to the archival system. The black squares each represent a story, placed on the map
						according to location, and when clicked take the user to the respective continent page. From
						there, the user can explore stories submitted from that specific area of the world. This is only
						way one in which the user can engage with the archival system of ‘Scattered Offerings’.
						There are many similar survival stories between the communities of Cambodians scattered
						across the world. ‘Scattered Offerings’ seeks to collect, preserve and archive the experiences of
						the Khmer Rouge. By submitting their stories on ‘Scattered Offerings’, Cambodians can engage
						by contributing to the archival of stories online. To share these stories could act as therapy for
						some, providing a platform to reconnect with the scattered Cambodian community to heal old
						pain and bring closure to families. This is also a platform for younger generations that want to
						learn more about their own history and reconnect with their culture. With the website’s goal of
						trying to promote Cambodian culture and preserve knowledge for future generations, I hope that
						Cambodians can regain a sense of identity through this website before this history is forgotten.
