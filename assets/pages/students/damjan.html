						A project based in augmented reality, i picked the subject
						to force me to learn how to code ad work in new technological mediums

						In
						general, each image poster act like a target for that topic at hand,

						the
						first being distortion, on the topic of online sexuality distortion specifically.


						My intentions were to be negative on the topic, due to the
						fact that it is a pressing underbelly issue that a lot of young men face, the consequences being that they start
						viewing sexuality in a disconnected form. The female figures are essentially expressed as mannequins with
						exaggerated figures, almost comically
						large. I added more distortion to the mesh, to accentuate the artificiality, the dissolving of sexuality.

						The second image target is on the topic of distraction,
						my intention was to visually display the online distraction artifacts we face in our daily internet use,
						fragments of internet forms that take away our attention from pressing issues occurring in the world

						such as the bombing in Yemen, and the loss of aquatic life,
						I made these messages that require our attention buried in the back hidden by the sea of distraction

						The third image is on how the internet, specifically social media and how it is numbing us to reality.

						The feedback loop consequences of social media such as Instagram cause us to value fake realities or over
						exaggerated versions of our lives and environment in order to stand out, in turn, we get an illusive perspective
						on how cities and environments look and subsequently
						get disappointed when in reality it was only a figment of social media's imagination.

						The 4th image target was on how the internet itself is changing
						how we view each other in term of nationality and blurring the separation.

						We
						are in amongst a time zone in human history where we are becoming one, via the internet. So I displayed an
						arrangement of flags all collided in a colage, to give a negative expression, of separation that countries now,
						then when you scan the image target,
						you see one flag being placed on top, to suggest its new dominance over the old world, and the image is an imaged
						internet nationality, with the worldwide web logo acting as the symbol.
